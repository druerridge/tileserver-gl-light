# tileserver-gl-light

A specific implementation for our Google Cloud App Engine.

A trimmed down fork of [tileserver-gl](https://github.com/klokantech/tileserver-gl) for serving MBTiles and
predefined Mapbox GL styles.
Built to support serving vectortiles from [OSM2VectorTiles](http://osm2vectortiles.org/).

## Get Started

Install `tileserver-gl-light` from npm.

```bash
npm install -g tileserver-gl-light
```

Now download vector tiles from [OSM2VectorTiles](http://osm2vectortiles.org/downloads/).

```

Start `tileserver-gl-light` with the downloaded vector tiles.
